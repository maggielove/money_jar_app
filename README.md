**Sample User log in info:**  
**email:** john@john.com  
**password:** password

With savingsTracker, users can quantify their self-control when it comes to impulse buys. Instead of just leaving a store empty-handed, users can record the purchase they resisted buying: the name of the item, its price, and its category. As items are added to a user's account, the savings add up, giving users a record of how much they've saved by not buying things they could live without.

## User Stories 
* As a user, I want to be able to sign up. 
* As a user, I want to be able to log in to view my account.
* As a user, I want to be able to add an item to the list of items I haven't bought. 
* As a user, I want to view the total amount I've saved by not buying things on impulse. 
* As a user, I want to delete an item from the list if I end up buying it
* As a user, I want to see deleted items reflected in my total savings. 
* As a user, I want to be able to edit an item on my list. 

## Technologies Used
* Ruby on Rails 
* postgreSQL database
* Heroku for deployment

## Ideas to further this app: 
* Let user enter a long-term financial goal they have (ex: ticket to Thailand) and the cost. Include a graph that shows a user how close they are to their goal. 
* Let user view items on their list by category. 
* Let user add items they don't buy to a wish list that they can send to friends and family.
